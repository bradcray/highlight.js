Do once to get started
======================

# Make sure 'node' and 'npm' are available.
# On Mac:
    brew install node

# Install dependencies (from within root highlight.js directory):
    npm install


How to build/test Chapel interactively
======================================

# Build Chapel support only:
    node tools/build.js -n chapel

# Open interactive webpage for highlighting:
    open tools/developer.html

# Note that autodetect is currently "off" for Chapel, so you'll need
  to select the language manually


How to build/test all languages automatically
=============================================

# Build and test everything:
    npm run build_and_test


How to add a new test
=====================

# I developed test within interactive developer.html above, then paste
# the Chapel code into test/markup/mytest.txt and the code from the
# "Markup" window into test/markup/mytest.expect.txt
